# docker-volume-test

Using `docker` and `docker-compose` (you need to install that locally on your machine), we are exploring the volume mount. Please ensure that you have `tree` installed on your machine as well.

## running

Run the shell script: `test.sh` (you might need to change the script with `chmod +x test.sh`)

## explaination

You cannot have all the files copied to 2 volumes when one volume reference a directory inside another volume
